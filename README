This is a demo for iotivity 1.0.0 on several different devices, include a demo server on Arduino with Grove starter kit,
a demo server on Raspberry Pi 2 with GrovePi, a demo client which is able to run on ARM v7 devices or on just on a PC.
The demo client can find the demo server and send/receive requests.

The following are the build instructions and hardware configurations.

Arduino with Grove starter kit (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Starter-Kit-for-Arduino-p-1855.html)
  Hardware configurations
    1. Arduino Due board

    2. Plug Grove on Arduino Due

    3. Connect Grove sensors to Grove board
         Grove Buzzer:             D2
         Grove Button:             D3
         Grove Serno:              D6
         Grove LED:                D7
         Grove Touch:              D8
         Grove Temperature sensor: A0
         Grove Sound sebsor:       A1
         Grove Light sensor:       A2
         Grove Angle sensor:       A3
         Grove RGB LCD:            SDA1, SCL1
             (The second TWI interface on Arduino Due needs to add a 1.5k pullup resister to SDA1 and SCL1 to make it work,
              please see the second_I2C_LCD.jpg.
              For the first TWI, the pullup resister is board build-in, no need to add it.)

    4. Plug Arduino ethernet shield on Grove


  Build instructions
    1. Setup environment
       source ./env-setup

    2. Build iotivity with arduino-1.5.7
       ./build_iotivity_arduino.sh

    3. Build the demo server only
       ./build_iotivity_arduino.sh build demoserver

    4. Program the demoserver to Arduino Due board
       ./build_iotivity_arduino.sh program demoserver

    5. The demo server is located in iotivity-1.0.0/resource/csdk/stack/samples/arduino/SimpleClientServer/demoserver


Raspberry Pi 2 with GrovePi (http://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi/)
  Hardware configurations
    1. Raspberry Pi 2

    2. Plug GrovePi on Raspberry Pi 2

    3. Connect GrovePi sensors to GrovePi board
         GrovePi Button:                          D3
         GrovePi Red LED:                         D4
         GrovePi Green LED:                       D5
         GrovePi Blue LED:                        D6
         GrovePi Temperature and Humidity sensor: D7
         GrovePi Buzzer:                          D8
         GrovePi Light sensor:                    A0
         GrovePi Sound sensor:                    A1
         GrovePi LCD:                             I2C-2

  Build instructions
    1. Build Iotivity on Raspberry Pi 2, please copy iotivity-demo to Raspberry Pi 2 and setup environment
       source ./env-setup

    2. Install packages for building iotivity
       sudo apt-get install scons git-core ssh g++ python-dev autotools-dev libicu-dev build-essential libbz2-dev
