This is a demo for iotivity 1.0.0 on several different devices, include a demo server on Arduino with Grove starter kit,
a demo server on Raspberry Pi 2 with GrovePi, a demo client which is able to run on ARM v7 devices or on just on a PC.
The demo client can find the demo server and send/receive requests.

The following are the build instructions and hardware configurations.

Arduino
  Hardware configurations
    1. Arduino Due board

    2. Plug Grove on Arduino Due

    3. Connect Grove sensors to Grove board
         Grove Buzzer:             D2
         Grove Button:             D3
         Grove Serno:              D6
         Grove LED:                D7
         Grove Touch:              D8
         Grove Temperature sensor: A0
         Grove Sound sebsor:       A1
         Grove Light sensor:       A2
         Grove Angle sensor:       A3
         Grove RGB LCD:            SDA1, SCL1
             (The second TWI interface on Arduino Due needs to add a 1.5k pullup resister to SDA1 and SCL1 to make it work,
              please see the second_I2C_LCD.jpg.
              For the first TWI, the pullup resister is board build-in, no need to add it.)

    4. Plug Arduino ethernet shield on Grove


  Build instructions
    1. setup environment
       source env-setup

    2. build iotivity with arduino-1.5.7
       ./build_iotivity_arduino.sh

    3. build the demo server only
       ./build_iotivity_arduino.sh build demoserver

    4. program the demoserver to Arduino Due board
       ./build_iotivity_arduino.sh program demoserver

    5. the demo server is located in iotivity-1.0.0/resource/csdk/stack/samples/arduino/SimpleClientServer/demoserver
